    "- In early days, $LiAsF_6$ and $LiClO_4$ were used but the former is toxic and latter can lead to safety risks (perchlorates can be explosive). This led to $LiPF_6$ salts being more widely used. Today's commercial Li-ion batteries use electrolytes with $LiPF_6$. It should be noted that $LiPF_6$ is very sensitive to trace moisture and can produce HF gas. $LiPF_6$ also forms a passivating layer on the aluminum current collector. \n",
    "\n",
    "$LiTFSI$ and $LiFSI$ can also form stable SEI, and are thermally stable and conductive, but neither form good passivating films on the aluminum current collector. \n",

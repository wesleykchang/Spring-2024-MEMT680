This is a course on batteries and electrochemical energy storage, developed by Wes Chang at Drexel University. The course is for anyone interested in the battery field, and is attended by both undergraduates and graduate students. 

Course description: As we work towards a renewably powered and electrified world, weâ€™re faced with important decisions to build the right energy storage technologies. The rechargeable Li-ion battery has emerged, after half a century of development, as the key technology for electrification of transportation and the grid. This course will be seminar-style and invite students to critically assess new battery technologies in light of their promises and current limitations, and to ground our analyses in both thermodynamic truths and techno-economic realities.

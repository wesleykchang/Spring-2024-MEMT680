Batteries and Renewable Energy Storage Systems 

Graduate-level special topics course: As we work towards a renewably powered and electrified world, weÂ¿re faced with important decisions to build the right energy storage technologies. The rechargeable Li-ion battery has emerged, after half a century of development, as the key technology for electrification of transportation and the grid. This course will be seminar-style and invite students to critically assess new battery technologies in light of their promises and current limitations, and to ground our analyses in both thermodynamic truths and techno-economic realities.
